## Introduction

Fumadocs <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast, flexible,
and composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router.

Fumadocs has different parts:

- **Docs** - documentation for all my projects
- **Blog** - blog about technology and stuff
